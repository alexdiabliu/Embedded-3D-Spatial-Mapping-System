# Embedded-3D-Spatial-Mapping-System
An embedded system that uses a VL53L1X Time-of-Flight sensor and stepper motor (via TM4C1294 microcontroller) to perform 360Â° scanning and generate 3D point cloud maps of indoor environments. Features real-time UART/I2C communication, GPIO-based user control, and visualization via Open3D.
